## Notes:
* This was originally meant to be created using python curses, but I decided to switch to simple Batch/CMD script after realizing that my installed Python version did not support curses.
* Possibly creating a Powershell/Bash version.
* In the works.
* Created mainly using the default notepad utility platform for Windows.
